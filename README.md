VipinMI2024

Overview
VipinMI2024 is a repository showcasing a variety of data analysis and machine learning projects implemented in Jupyter notebooks. The projects cover classification, regression, and exploratory data analysis across diverse datasets, including movie ratings, Titanic survival, diamond prices, Diwali sales, housing prices, and the Iris dataset. Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and visualization libraries, this repository demonstrates proficiency in data science and machine learning techniques.
Projects
The repository includes the following Jupyter notebook projects:

Movie Data Analysis (movie.ipynb)

Analyzes a movie dataset, likely focusing on ratings, genres, or box office performance.
Tasks may include exploratory data analysis, visualization, or predictive modeling (e.g., rating prediction).
Features: Likely includes movie titles, ratings, genres, or release years.


Titanic Survival Prediction (Titanic.ipynb)

Classification task to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
Uses features like age, sex, class, and fare.
Models: Logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods.


Diamond Price Regression (Diamonds (1).ipynb)

Regression analysis to predict diamond prices.
Features: Carat, cut, clarity, color, and depth.
Models: Linear regression or advanced techniques like random forests.


Diwali Sales Analysis (Diwali_sales.ipynb)

Exploratory data analysis of sales data during Diwali.
Analyzes trends, customer demographics, or product categories.
Visualizations: Sales by region, category, or time.


Housing Price Prediction (Housing.ipynb)

Regression task to predict house prices, possibly using the Boston Housing dataset or similar.
Features: Number of rooms, location, or other property attributes.
Models: Linear regression, gradient boosting, or neural networks.


Iris Classification (iris.ipynb)

Classification task on the Iris dataset to predict flower species.
Features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.
Models: K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, or decision trees.
